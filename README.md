### Motivation
I started developing this project for the wrong reason: my goal was to design and grow up my programming skill.
Actually it was satisfying at all to create a scalable and genetics project.

### Introduction and Content
* Pattern used:
  - Service Locator
  - Event Dispatcher
  - Singleton
* Serialize and historicized saving Achievements: Use of serialization of generic types T with manager Achievements with generic management
* Design scalability and generic reuse of classes and interfaces
* Design division and use of Assembly Definition
* UI management and serialized programming
* Use of Service Locator for Singleton management
* Enemy navigation using NavMesh
* Insertion of Music and basic effects
* Creation of build and screen adaptation

### Code Example
Event dispatcher example 
```
public Dictionary<IEntity.TypeEvents, Action<object>> actions = new Dictionary<IEntity.TypeEvents, Action<object>>();

public void SetAction(object value, IEntity.TypeEvents events)
{
    if (actions.Keys.Contains(events))
    actions[events].Invoke(value);
}

public void RegisterAction(Action<object> a, IEntity.TypeEvents events)
{
    if (actions.ContainsKey(events))
    {
      actions[events] += a;
    }
    else
    {
      actions.Add(events, a);
    }
}
```
Achievements generics example 
```
private static Dictionary<Type, SaveData<T>> dicSerializableObj = new Dictionary<Type, SaveData<T>>();

public class SaveData<T> : ISerializable where T : class
{
    public object GetObj()
    {
       return data;
    }

    public void SetObj(object obj)
    {
      data = (T)obj;
    }

    [SerializeReference]
    public T data;
}

[Serializable]
[SerializeField]
public class ListSaveData<T> where T : class
{
     [SerializeField]
     public List<SaveData<T>> listData;
}
```
### Assets and Audio

Use all free asssets.

### Game Logic

Survival on random level generation, every certain time get a new random power for survive to enemies. 

### Bugs

Please report bugs as issues.
